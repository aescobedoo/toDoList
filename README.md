### About me
Hi! My name is Antonio, I'm currently learning the bascis of HTML, CSS and JS. This project raises because I want to challenge my self and put in practice some skills I learned about the langagues mentioned before.

### How did I come up with the challenge?
I really didn't. I asked chat GPT to put a challenge to me and this is what it resulted from that prompt.
#### Promt outcome:
##### Requirements:

- Create a web-based to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Users should be able to:
- Add new tasks to the list.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- View all tasks in the list.
- Use localStorage to persist the tasks even after the page is refreshed.

##### Additional Features (Optional):

- Allow users to edit tasks.
- Add a due date and priority level to tasks.
- Implement filtering options (e.g., show only completed tasks, show only high-priority tasks).

##### Instructions:

- Use HTML for the structure of the application.
- Use CSS for styling the application.
- Use JavaScript for the interactive features and functionality.
- Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

### Learning journey
I've been learning how to code with:
- [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)
- [youtube](https://www.youtube.com)
It's been a hell of a ride and I feel like there's still a really LONG way to go. But I am really excited about this journey.
